<h1>About SpaceX</h1>
<img src="src/img/elon.jpg" alt="Elon Musk" id="elonImg" class="imgs">
<p>SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp.) is a private aerospace company founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the
    ambitious goal of making space travel more affordable—and ultimately enabling human life on Mars. Headquartered in
    Hawthorne, California, SpaceX has revolutionized the space industry with cutting-edge innovations, from the reusable
    Falcon rockets to the powerful Starship launch system currently in development.</p>
<p>The company made history in 2012 by becoming the first private company to deliver cargo to the International Space
    Station, and again in 2020 by launching astronauts into orbit aboard the Crew Dragon spacecraft. With bold projects
    like the Starlink satellite internet constellation and ongoing missions to the Moon and Mars, SpaceX is reshaping
    the future of space exploration.</p>
<p>At the heart of SpaceX is Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur known for challenging the status quo. His leadership
    continues to drive SpaceX toward goals that once seemed like science fiction, including interplanetary travel, lunar
    bases, and a sustainable human presence beyond Earth.</p>
<h2>The idea of SpaceX</h2>
<p>SpaceX began as a bold idea from Elon Musk: to dramatically reduce the cost of space travel and make Mars
    colonization possible. Since its founding in 2002, the company has transformed from a small startup into one of the
    most influential aerospace companies in the world. But the journey hasn’t been easy.</p>
<h2>The Early Struggles</h2>
<p>SpaceX's first rocket, the Falcon 1, was a small, two-stage launch vehicle. It failed its first three launches
    between 2006 and 2008, nearly bankrupting the company. But on the fourth try, SpaceX made history—Falcon 1 became
    the first privately developed, liquid-fueled rocket to reach Earth orbit. That success secured a NASA contract and
    gave SpaceX the lifeline it needed.</p>

<h2>Falcon 9</h2>
<p>The next major milestone came with the Falcon 9. Designed to be larger, more powerful, and partially reusable, Falcon
    9 quickly became the workhorse of the SpaceX fleet. In 2015, after several attempts, SpaceX achieved its first
    successful vertical landing of a Falcon 9 booster—a breakthrough in rocket reusability that has since saved the
    company millions and revolutionized the industry.</p>

<p>Since then, Falcon 9 has launched satellites, cargo, and astronauts to the International Space Station. It has
    become one of the most reliable launch systems in history, with dozens of successful missions.</p>
<h2>Starship and the Future</h2>
<p>Now, all eyes are on Starship, a fully reusable rocket designed for missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Although early test flights have seen explosive endings, each has provided valuable data. SpaceX is rapidly iterating on Starship, and its first full-stack orbital launches mark an exciting step toward true deep-space capability.</p>

<h2>A Legacy of Innovation and Resilience</h2>
<p>The story of SpaceX is one of trial, error, and relentless progress. From fiery failures to record-breaking achievements, the company has stayed committed to pushing boundaries. Guided by Elon Musk’s vision, SpaceX continues to inspire the world and shape the future of space travel—one rocket launch at a time.</p>
